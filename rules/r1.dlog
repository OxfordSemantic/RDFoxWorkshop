# Find if a driver has been in a race (this is similar to axiom set 8)
[?driver, :hasRacedIn, ?race] :-
    [?result, :results_race, ?race],
    [?result, :results_driver, ?driver] .

# Note this looks like the following write query:
#
# INSERT {?driver :hasRacedIn ?race}
# WHERE {
#     ?result :results_race ?race ;
#      :results_driver ?driver .
# }
