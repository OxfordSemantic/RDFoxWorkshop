# Find if a driver has been in a race (this is similar to axiom set 8)
[?driver, :hasRacedIn, ?race] :-
    [?result, :result_race, ?race],
    [?result, :result_driver, ?driver] .

# Note this looks like the following write query:
#
# INSERT {?driver :hasRacedIn ?race}
# WHERE {
#     ?result :result_race ?race ;
#      :result_driver ?driver .
# }
