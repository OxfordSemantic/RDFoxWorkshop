#Chaning the ontology, e.g. a race can only have one winner is not true.
#Exercies? PC says no


#Queries:
1-Look at the following familt of drivers: Fittipaldi? Schumachers.
you will see that there are lots of different types of links. What if we wanted to have a hierarchy of properties instead?
We will see that this is possible in OWL.

2-Ok, no let's think about defining a winner and a polesitter.
And what about drivers who are both?

3-Now, our properties always go in one direction (as we originally use keys from a SQL database.)
But what if we wanted to define the inverse?
And what about 'shortcuts'? At the end of the day we want data to be 'normalised' but also easily navigable.
The two need not be at odds.
Show the relavance of inverses on faceted search.

4-Finally, how do we deal with inconsistencies and duplication?
sameAs, functional, disjointness.


Then we show the ontology, and import it.
