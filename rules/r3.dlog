# Rules offer many advanced features
# E.g. aggregation

[?driver, :hasRaceCount, ?raceCount] :-
    AGGREGATE(
        [?driver, :hasRacedIn, ?race]
        ON ?driver
        BIND COUNT(?race) AS ?raceCount
    ) .

# Notice that we are using the previously 'inferred' property :hasRacedIn
#Â We can use this property in queries too, of course, to make them faster and more readable
